Tests for the 18/03/2021
This repository has been reused for a second exercice (back-end for modern-intra)

We cannot figure how to connect this project to the front-end modern-intra

###New features

* user routes and model have been improved
* company routes and model have been added
* api.test.js have been completed with the new tests

(note : you need to drop your test/dev databases and redo the migrations since some models have changed)
